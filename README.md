# Real Estate Price Prediction 
This project, developed during the university course in Data Mining and Text Analytics, aims to predict house prices in the city of Milan. The objective is to provide a data-driven approach to pricing newly listed properties, avoiding reliance solely on heuristics.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a student passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning. This project represents a practical application of my knowledge, with the goal of building reproducible and adaptable predictive models for real estate pricing.

Real Estate Price Predictionâ€¨Project Description
The project aims to analyze and predict real estate prices in Milan using Machine Learning models. Data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling processes are performed.
Key Steps
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
    * Import the dataset containing Milan real estate prices.
    * Remove columns with more than 25% missing values to ensure data quality.
    * Standardize column names to lowercase.
    * Save the cleaned dataset for future use.
2. Feature Engineering
    * Create new features derived from existing ones (e.g., total_features).
    * Correct and normalize numerical values (e.g., area_m2, condominium fees).
    * Extract coordinates of properties to create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of properties and divide the city into a spatial grid for geographic data representation.
3. Dataset Splitting
    * Separate independent features (X) from the target variable (y).
    * Split the dataset into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
    * Standardize features to ensure consistency across models.
4. Model Training
    * Random Forest Regressor: A model based on decision trees for price prediction.
    * Linear Regression: A linear regression model to compare performance.
    * Train the models on the training data.
5. Performance Evaluation
    * Calculate error metrics for each model:
        * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        * Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)
    * Compare actual and predicted values using scatter plots.
6. Result Visualization
    * Generate comparison graphs between actual and predicted prices.
    * Add annotations with evaluation metrics to the graphs.
    * Divide the city into grids for better geographic analysis of prices.


# Requirements
* Python 3.x (or later version)
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, jupyter notebook)

* # Project Execution
1 Create a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment prevents dependency conflicts:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
#i've created the venv using anaconda navigator like so:
"conda create -n realestate" 
"conda activate realestate"
```
2. Load and clean the data.
3. Create new features and normalize values.
4. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
5. Train Machine Learning models.
6. Evaluate performance and visualize results.

The project provides a data-driven approach to predicting real estate prices, combining Machine Learning techniques and geographic analysis.


```

### 4. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy geopandas shapely geopy seaborn
```

This project serves as both an academic exploration and a practical tool for real estate price prediction in Milan. ðŸŒŸ
